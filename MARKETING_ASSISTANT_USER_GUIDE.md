## Best Practices

### ✅ Do's
- **Review content** before copying - Make sure it matches your brand voice
- **Customize when needed** - AI content is a starting point, not final copy
- **Test different content types** - See which formats work best for your deals
- **Use all 5 subject lines** - Test them in your email service to see which gets best open rates
- **Include the fine print** - Especially for signage (expiration dates, restrictions)
- **Leverage the hashtags** - Use them strategically for social media reach

### ❌ Don'ts
- **Don't copy-paste without review** - Personalize when needed
- **Don't ignore character limits** - Ads and some platforms have strict limits
- **Don't skip the fine print** - Legal compliance is important
- **Don't use outdated information** - Always verify deal details are current
- **Don't forget to test** - Try A/B testing different generated content

## Tips for Better Results

### 1. Be Specific About Deals
The more detailed your deal information (restrictions, category, location), the better the AI content will be.

### 2. Understand Your Audience
Lake County Local Deals targets residents looking for value. The AI content reflects this with:
- Local references ("Lake County")
- Value emphasis (savings amounts, percentages)
- Community-focused tone

### 3. Customize Subject Lines
Pick the subject line that:
- Best describes your offer
- Would make YOU click the email
- Matches your typical communication style

### 4. Use Platform-Specific Content
Don't just copy Facebook content to Instagram. Use the platform-specific version:
- Instagram content is more visual/hashtag-focused
- Twitter content is punchier
- Facebook content is longer and more conversational

### 5. A/B Test When Possible
If you can, test different generated content:
- Try multiple subject lines
- Test different ad headlines
- Compare platform approaches

## Troubleshooting

### "Daily limit reached"
You've used all your available content for today. Your limit resets at midnight.
- Check your subscription tier for your daily limit
- Upgrade to a higher tier for more daily content

### Content doesn't appear
- Refresh the page
- Check your browser console for errors
- Make sure you selected a deal before clicking generate

### Generated content seems generic
The AI bases content on your deal information. Adding more details helps:
- More specific descriptions
- Unique selling points
- Clear restriction information

### Can't copy content
Try these fixes:
- Use the Copy button instead of manual selection
- Refresh the page
- Try a different browser
